# QUICK START GUIDE
# Smart Student Assistant - T.I.P. Manual Q&A System

## 📋 Checklist - What You Need

Before running the application, ensure you have:

✅ Python 3.10 or higher installed
✅ All 5 files in the same directory:
   1. app.py
   2. requirements.txt  
   3. manual_data.json
   4. section_examples.json
   5. README.md

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Open Terminal/Command Prompt
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd path/to/smart-student-assistant
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- streamlit (web framework)
- sentence-transformers (NLP model)
- faiss-cpu (vector search)
- scikit-learn (similarity metrics)
- numpy, pandas (data processing)

**Note**: First installation may take 3-5 minutes.

### Step 3: Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**First Run**: The app will download the embedding model (~90MB) from Hugging Face.
This is a one-time download and will be cached for future use.

### Step 4: Access the Web Interface
The application will automatically open in your browser at:
```
http://localhost:8501
```

If it doesn't open automatically, copy the URL from the terminal.

## 🎯 Testing the System

### Try These Sample Questions:

1. **Admissions**
   - "What are the admission requirements?"
   - "How do I apply to T.I.P.?"
   - "What documents do I need for admission?"

2. **Grading**
   - "How are grades calculated?"
   - "What does a grade of 1.00 mean?"
   - "What is the passing grade?"

3. **Scholarships**
   - "What scholarships are available?"
   - "How can I apply for financial aid?"
   - "Tell me about the Quirino scholarship"

4. **Academic Issues**
   - "What is academic probation?"
   - "What happens if I fail most of my courses?"
   - "How many units can I take on probation?"

5. **Student Life**
   - "What services are available for students?"
   - "What is the attendance requirement?"
   - "Can I join fraternities?"

## 📊 Expected Output

For each question, the system provides:
1. ✅ **Extracted Answer** - 2-3 relevant sentences from the manual
2. 📂 **Section Classification** - Which section of the manual contains the answer
3. 💯 **Confidence Score** - How confident the system is (0-100%)
4. 📋 **Matching Snippets** - Full context from the manual (expandable)
5. 👍👎 **Feedback Buttons** - Help improve the system

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Module not found" error
**Solution**: 
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Problem: "manual_data.json not found"
**Solution**: Ensure all files are in the same directory as app.py

### Problem: Port 8501 already in use
**Solution**: 
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```

### Problem: Model download fails
**Solution**: 
- Check internet connection
- Try again (sometimes Hugging Face is slow)
- Manually download model from: https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

### Problem: Slow performance
**Solution**:
- First query is always slower (model loading)
- Subsequent queries should be <2 seconds
- Close other applications to free up RAM

## 📈 Using the Feedback System

1. After getting an answer, click:
   - **👍 Helpful** - if the answer was useful
   - **👎 Not Helpful** - if the answer needs improvement

2. Feedback is logged to `feedback_log.csv` (auto-created)

3. View analytics in the **sidebar** (shows most asked sections)

## 🎓 Understanding the System

### How It Works (Simplified):

1. **You ask a question** → "How can I apply for a scholarship?"

2. **System classifies** → Determines this is about "Scholarships and Financial Aid"

3. **System searches** → Finds 3 most relevant chunks from that section

4. **System extracts** → Pulls out 2-3 sentences that best answer your question

5. **You get answer** → With confidence score and source reference

### No AI Text Generation!
- This system does NOT use GPT or large language models
- It uses **semantic search** and **extractive summarization**
- All answers come directly from the T.I.P. Student Manual
- No hallucinations or made-up information

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- ✅ **100% Local**: All processing happens on your machine
- ✅ **No API Keys**: No external services required
- ✅ **No Data Collection**: Feedback stored locally only
- ✅ **Offline Ready**: Works without internet after setup

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "What is the GPA requirement for Summa Cum Laude?" 
   vs. "Tell me about honors"

2. **Use Keywords**: Include terms like "admission", "graduation", "scholarship"

3. **Check Snippets**: Click "View Matching Snippets" to see full context

4. **Try Variations**: If first answer isn't helpful, rephrase your question

5. **Provide Feedback**: This helps track system performance
